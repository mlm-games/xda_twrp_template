[COLOR="Violet"][SIZE="4"][B]What is TWRP?[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
[URL="https://twrp.me"]Team Win Recovery Project[/URL] 3.x, or twrp for short, is a custom recovery built with ease of use and customization in mind. Its a fully touch driven user interface no more volume rocker or power buttons to mash. The GUI is also fully XML driven and completely theme-able. You can change just about every aspect of the look and feel.
In short: It allows you to back up and restore your data, flash custom ROMs to your device, repair broken file systems, and root your device.

[COLOR="Violet"][SIZE="4"][B]KNOWN LIMITATIONS:[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
The following are some known limitations either due to the design nature of Samsung devices or a problem with ROM themselves. Please read carefully :-
- Make sure to read the readme of the [URL="{{link}}"]device tree[/URL] once as it may contain specific info regarding the device.
- You can flash magisk 27.0 zip from twrp, but make sure to not reboot once you have entered the device after factory reset and checking if the OEM unlocking option is greyed-out/visible, or it can cause a bootloop. Also open magisk once after that.
- YOU WILL LOSE YOUR DATA/INTERNAL-STORAGE WHEN YOU RUN MULTIDISABLER AND CLEAR DATA. So backup everything beforehand
