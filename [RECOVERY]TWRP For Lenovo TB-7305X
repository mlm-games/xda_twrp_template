[COLOR="Violet"][SIZE="4"][B]What is TWRP?[/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]
[URL="https://twrp.me"]Team Win Recovery Project[/URL] 3.x, or twrp for short, is a custom recovery built with ease of use and customization in mind. Its a fully touch driven user interface no more volume rocker or power buttons to mash. The GUI is also fully XML driven and completely theme-able. You can change just about every aspect of the look and feel.
In short: It allows you to back up and restore your data, flash custom ROMs to your device, repair broken file systems, and root your device.
